About the pot mechanics, what if 2 meds are found? Is it still $430,000 or is there just a maximum of $100k per mark (assuming no 0.9 multiplier?)?


[05/20/2022 8:16 PM] cloudellie
Yeah, I believe it's just ">0 Mediums = pot size increases to $430k" üôÇ

What if 5 meds and 1 high is found? Does the high increase also the payout for meds? Then meds would receive more if a valid high is submitted.

for the execute functions in conduit.sol why not just return a true or false instead of returning a 4 byte value?


[05/21/2022 5:12 AM] 0age
Mostly just a little added assurance; it‚Äôs relatively easy to mix up call status and a boolean return value unless you‚Äôre careful (and anyone integrating with a conduit absolutely needs to be careful!)


[05/21/2022 5:14 AM] 0age
Similar pattern exists for EIP-1271 and it does help disambiguate that you‚Äôre calling an interface that‚Äôs actually compliant with the EIP


[05/21/2022 5:15 AM] 0age
Plus it‚Äôs basically the same overhead (unless you include the extra 3 bytes of runtime code which just bumps up deployment cost / contract size)

if you're here already, you can participate, but you will need to do KYC if you're eligible for rewards, which is also the requirement for _certified_ role, and the current _certified_ role becomes _*certified+*_ might be wrong...

[05/21/2022 5:46 PM] trust90
`
As all offer and consideration items are allocated against one another in memory, there are scenarios in which the actual received item amount will differ from the amount specified by the order ‚Äî notably, this includes items with a fee-on-transfer mechanic.
`
Is this to say that every scenario in which recipient receives less than the specified amount considered out of scope? Cuz that's a pretty massive discount for the protocol.


[05/21/2022 6:32 PM] cloudellie
This is correct -- thank you! I'm trying to get the C4 docs updated ASAP as I know it's confusing.


[05/21/2022 7:03 PM] 0age
If the token in question is fee-on-transfer or doesn‚Äôt credit receiver 100 tokens when you call transferFrom with amount 100 then yeah that‚Äôs non-standard behavior (and honestly should be discouraged IMHO)

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05/21/2022 7:04 PM] 0age
But if you _do_ want to support precise payouts of fee-on-transfer tokens with Seaport you can still do it by calling through a wrapper contract that checks balances before and after like uniswap router does for fee-on-transfer tokens with minReceived


[05/21/2022 7:05 PM] 0age
Or can even compute post-transfer amounts in real-time with a zone + tipping


[05/21/2022 9:08 PM] trust90
I understand but that doesn't answer the question


[05/21/2022 9:14 PM] 0age
There are lots of scenarios where a recipient receiving less than the specified amount would be solidly in scope and would represent a high-severity bug ‚Äî but if the scenario is dependent on idiosyncratic behavior of a specific, non-compliant flavor of token then it‚Äôs not in scope because the token is not designed in a way that makes it ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to exchange by default, if that makes sense

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05/21/2022 9:18 PM] 0age
Two examples that are pointed out in the docs are fee-on-transfer tokens (remediation is to check the balance after the swap) and tokens that have some modifiable state other than just their balance / approvals through standard ERC20/721/1155 methods (like tokens that have collateral locked up inside them, i.e. an initial transfer to a recipient with an onReceived hook that makes a reentrant call into the token with collateral and removes it before transferring the token)

{Reactions}
SilvNoted 

[05/21/2022 9:24 PM] 0age
The alternative is to perform balance checks after transfer by default for every token, which adds a lot of unnecessary overhead in the vast majority of cases where behavior conforms to the eip specs (I.e. getting a recipient‚Äôs dai balance, sending them 100 dai, checking the balance again, and ensuring the delta is 100 dai is a real waste when you know that compliant erc20s like dai will either faithfully increment the recipient‚Äôs balance by 100 or will revert / return false)


[05/22/2022 3:00 AM] premm.eth
Jest getting going on this. I was able to get all the tests to pass using hardhat, but I think there are forge tests as well? I am new to forge, so just setting it up. Got this error: . ". . . lib/murky/src/Merkle.sol": No such file or directory"

ok, yeah that's what I needed. will try it.


[05/22/2022 4:53 AM] Deleted User
There are other ways to solve fee-on-transfer without checking balanceOf each time.


[05/22/2022 5:24 AM] 0age
Yeah, you could also have it be part of the item type to indicate that something‚Äôs a fee-on-transfer and only check the balance then (though you could still end up with less that expected if you didn‚Äôt use that type), or is there a totally different approach I‚Äôm not considering?


[05/22/2022 6:36 AM] Deleted User
Yeah or just forbid fee on transfer tokens


[05/22/2022 7:03 AM] 0age
How do you forbid them at the protocol level without falling back to some kind of whitelist? And who owns that whitelist?


[05/22/2022 8:11 AM] Deleted User
On the first interaction with token you do the balance check and then add token to mapping if it is without fee-on-transfer.
Revert if token is non standard.
On the next interaction you are just accessing the mapping from storage.
Thats how I do in my contracts to avoid additional runtime gas usage.


[05/22/2022 8:14 AM] Deleted User
The only thing is if someone makes fee-on-transfer enable/disable function in the token contract and bypass this check. Or if someone modifies balanceOf function.

This however does not bother me much because I have additional checks for mis-behavior in place but could be a case in your contract probably. For example, deposit fake token and withdraw something else valuable.


[05/22/2022 10:54 AM] 0age
That‚Äôs a pretty clever solution! SLOAD ain‚Äôt cheap though (and, as you note, won‚Äôt catch dynamic fee-on-transfer)


[05/22/2022 1:57 PM] 0x1f8b
I can assume reference is out of scope, right, unless there's a logical mismatch, no gas, right?

Yeah it is impossible to prevent someone using fee-on-transfer tokens.
Only forbid basic ones.
However it is better to organize contract code the way that does not break logic when someone uses fake tokens.
You can never trust contract calls.

you can still use Seaport with fee-on-transfer tokens, you're just going to end up with less tokens in your wallet at the end than the # you give on the order (just like you would if you gave that # to a direct call to `transferFrom` on that token)

If an issue/fix fixes a computation and also optimizes gas would that be under QA report or Gas Op? 

Would it also be considered low or medium if it doesn‚Äôt affect any funds or tokens?

Hey folks, lots of cool stuff here and finally getting to investigating! Just wondering, sorry if this was asked before, but what's the quickest way to generate a gas snapshot for a specific function? I'm just trying to get the `--gas-report` from the Consideration `fulfillBasicOrder` function, I got it by running the generic test (everything in lite mode) with `--gas-report` enabled, but I can't seem to find exactly which file I'm supposed to isolate to get *just* that :KEK:

Did you modify the source? If so you can also try overriding the contract size limit in the config

Would be really great if it was possible to extend the contest to give a weekend more, not sure if that‚Äôs possible or if there are other wardens for whom it would be helpful‚Ä¶

Quick question, can a team that got all members certified participate on the contest?


[06/01/2022 7:45 PM] oridabush
In addition to that, what happens in case that some members are not certified?

Did opensea develop your own UI for Seaport? Or you will passed this work to independent DApps developers?

The Seaport @code4rena competition has now ended ‚Äî thanks again to the many reviewers who participated! 

A summary of relevant findings will be made available soon, but I'd like to share some key findings and give a heads-up that we'll be deploying Seaport v1.1 to address them.

I bet that there won't be a mitigation contest. But there will be another Seaport 1.1 contest and so on until there aren't any medium and high issues left.

@0age  is it necessary to do that, I mean if I didn't do. Will i be disqualified? I am a bit confused with PR.


[06/07/2022 3:02 PM] 0x1f8b
First we should have the report to see if some of them was accepted, isn't it?


[06/07/2022 4:41 PM] 0age
Just clarifying for everyone ‚Äî any findings you submitted as part of the competition are being evaluated independently of the PRs that we're taking right now (the _judges_ evaluate those). The PRs are just if you'd _also_ like to be a contributor to Seaport!


[06/07/2022 4:41 PM] 0age
You do _not_ need to submit a PR in order for your findings to be accepted as valid

[06/07/2022 4:42 PM] 0age
(but you _should_ if you want to ensure that the finding makes its way into Seaport 1.1 in time as the formal competition review period will take a few weeks)

hi there, any reason opensea didnt go all-in foundry and still has some hardhat tests? more broadly, im wondering what are some tests that can only be done in hardhat but not foundry.


[07/26/2022 12:34 AM] AuditsAreUS#8939
The reason is that you can test for language specific bugs. It's good if your testing language is different to you source language.

Do the wardens listed include both the ones who are verified or not, or just the verified ones.


[08/01/2022 7:38 AM] cloudellie
The announcement includes everyone with a valid finding, whether or not they have completed the certification process. 

However, we cannot send awards to people who don‚Äôt complete certification.  So if you‚Äôre on the list and aren‚Äôt yet certified, now‚Äôs the time.

hey, does anyone know how does seaport generate its optimized-out files? more generally, did seaport do anything to bypass eip170 spurious dragon error?
